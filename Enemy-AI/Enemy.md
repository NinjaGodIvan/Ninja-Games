# Enemy Scripts

## Information
All scripts in this file are the children of the AI model to function the AI. Each script functions differently.

## Scripts
**Animate:** Animates the AI's walking, running, jumping, etc. I did not made this script, but I did edit some lines to function the AI differently.

**ChaseScript:** Has the AI follow a player or another AI depending on the Humanoid name. I did not made this script, but I did edit some lines to function the AI differently.

**GiveXP:** Runs after the player kills an enemy AI. When an AI gets killed, a player will gain one kill and XP. If a player reaches his target XP, he will level up by 1 and his HP will regenerate with a new max HP.

**Respawn:** Respawns AI in certain amount of seconds after he died.

**ZombieScript and DamageTag:** Inflicts damage to players and AIs. The DamageTag is the child of ZombieScript.
